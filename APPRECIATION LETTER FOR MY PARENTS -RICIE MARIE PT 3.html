<h1 style= "color: #1aab7d;">Dear Parents,</h1>
<p style= "color: #2fb464;"><em>I hope this letter will express even a small part of gratitude I feel for everything you have done for me. I want to take a moment to thank you for your trust and support as you both work together since the day that I was born until now. Your devotion and guidance serve as a strong bridge that supports me through success and happiness. From the small lessons you taught me in my everyday life to the bigger sacrifices you made just to make sure I had every opportunity to succeed, your dedication has shaped the person I am today.<br>
<br>
Your encouragement has been my strength, and your faith in me has inspired me to strive harder and never give up on my dreams. Whether it was celebrating my achievements or helping me when I am in my lowest points, your presence has been a constant source of comfort and reassurance.<br>
<br>
Thank you for always believing in me, even during the times when I doubted myself. Beyond your guidance and support, it is the values that you have implanted in me that I always keep myself in mind and treasure the most. You have taught me the importance of honesty and compassion. These lessons are gifts that I will carry with me always.<br>
<br>
I am deeply grateful for the countless sacrifices you have made to provide me with a better life. You have worked tirelessly, often putting my needs ahead of your own. Your selflessness and endless love are things I will cherish forever.<br>
<br>
I will work hard and endure everything to be successful in the future to give back all the sacrifices you had made for me. I will take care of you both, just as you did when I was a mere child. I will provide you both with everything you need and ask, just as you did when I always ask for something.<br>
<br>
Thank you for being my role models and my biggest cheerleaders. I am truly blessed to have you as my parents and I will always work hard to make you proud.<br></em>
<h2 style= "color: #19a764;">Sincerely yours, Ricie.</h2>
